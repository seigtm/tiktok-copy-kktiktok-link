# TikTok Copy KK Link

A simple Tampermonkey userscript that adds a button to TikTok Web for copying
`kktiktok.com` links, allowing TikTok videos to be embedded and played inline
in Telegram and other messengers.

## How it works

When viewing a TikTok video page (`/video/...`), the script adds a floating
**Copy KK link** button.

Clicking the button copies a `kktiktok.com` link to your clipboard.

> On TikTok desktop, the `/video/...` URL appears after opening the comments
> section of a video.

## Installation

1. Install the **Tampermonkey** browser extension
2. Open the `.user.js` file from this repository
3. Click **Install**
